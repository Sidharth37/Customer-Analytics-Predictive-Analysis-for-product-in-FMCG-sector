# Customer-Analytics-Predictive-Analysis-for-product-in-FMCG-sector

The main aim of the project is to identify key price points in the market, define customer segments, develop new pricing strategies based on competitive intelligence to capture the most possible market share and in turn maximize revenue. With the advent of online shopping, the data to make this happen has become increasingly possible, and something everybody is cashing on. In this project we have made an effort to analyze the probability of customers of buying a particular product from a product segment, probability of customer of buying a specific product brand, and the number of units a customer would buy.<br>

A full scaled project of this type is divided into 3 phases<br>
1. Segmentation
2. Targeting
3. Position 
<br>
We will be focusing on the segmentation and positioning part of it. Targeting is something that would require you to focus on the no quantitative part of the exercise, and is beyond the scope of the project.<br>
